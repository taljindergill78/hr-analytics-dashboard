# HR Analytics Dashboard
Visual HR analytics dashboard (Tableau) built for ASU coursework to explore employee attrition, performance, and satisfaction using real-world data.

This project analyzes a comprehensive HR dataset to uncover trends and patterns behind employee attrition, satisfaction, performance, and compensation. Built as part of the *Data Visualization and Reporting* course at Arizona State University, this group project uses **Tableau** and **Tableau Prep Builder** to create a public, interactive dashboard answering 14 business-critical HR questions.

## 🧠 Key Insights Answered
This dashboard was built to answer 14 HR-focused questions, including:
- What is our overall attrition rate by department and job role?
- Do salary hikes impact performance ratings?
- Are certain education fields linked with higher attrition or lower ratings?
- How does work-life balance, job involvement, and overtime affect retention?
- Is there a gender pay gap that correlates with attrition?

A full list of all 14 questions is documented in the [Reports](./Reports/) folder.
